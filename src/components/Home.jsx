          I am a passionate fullstack developer with a background in project
          management. I have always been fascinated by technology, and my love
          for it only grew stronger when I moved to London last year. I knew
          that I wanted to make a career in tech, so I enrolled in several
          online courses and completed an intense fullstack development
          bootcamp. During my bootcamp, I collaborated with a team of developers
          to create an app that was so successful that Code Your Future
          implemented it as a part of their final project assessment toolset. My
          teammates would say that I am a quick learner with exceptional
          critical thinking and problem-solving skills. They also say that I am
          easy to work with and always willing to help others. I am currently
          looking for an entry-level fullstack developer role where I can use my
          skills and passion to create innovative solutions to complex problems
          as well as learn and grow.
